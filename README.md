# Work/Day Scheduler  
## Project Description

Our assigment was to create a simple single page web application, which can we used as a daily planner, a work day planner, or any other type of day planner.

In this project, I am utilizing javascript, HTML, and CSS (framework and some custom styling). I am also utilizing localStorage to keep a track of the user's inputs into the calander. 

The hour alloted to each slot will change color depeneding on the condiiton of the event on the calander (past,present.future)
