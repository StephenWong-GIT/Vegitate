## VeggieTake(t)s Comments
* We decided on the Bulma CSS framework, which is responsive and mobile first. 
* We started by making a mock-up/wireframe of our web-application and two of it's views.
* Created an index.html page to build the skeleton of our app.
* Wrote the javascript to fetch trending movies of the week from "TheMovieDatabase.org" via one of their API endpoints.
* Continued on javascript functions to take all the movies returned in the payload, convert the data into an array, and build an HTML element for each item (movie) in the array.   
* We have an onclick event that runs another API fetch to youtube.com to find 3 relative videos, or trailers about the movie.
