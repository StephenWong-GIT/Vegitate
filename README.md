 Using APIs to get movie reviews from not some fresh sources (RottenTomatoes)


#User Story
As a user, I want to get the reviews for the selected one of the top 10 listed trending movies from a movie web-application. 
I want the reviews from multiple sources within one platform.
I would like to get a clean enough review to where I am not given any spoilers that ruins the movie for me. 
I also have the option to search for a specific movie.
Once searced and displayed, the movies displayed will show the movie name, date released, RottenTomatoe rating, a link to the trailer, and a list of reviews for the movie.
